BattView is intended to allow quick review of your battery level (percentage) because the status bar (either in a traditional DE like Gnome or KDE, or in a tiling manager using waybar, for example) is not present. This uses QT and allows the use of a keyboard combo to show the prompt. Its purpose is simply to allow the quick review of your current battery status.
